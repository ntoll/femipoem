There once was a coder called Femi,
Whose feet really were rather smelly,
  His ace coding skills,
  Caused a life full of thrils,
He found it hard not to go spend a penny.

Another programmer called Imran,
Like driving around in a big van,
  It was decked out with kit,
  That caused folks to have fits,
So the Police enforced a driving ban.

There was a third programmer called thomas,
who ate a lot of humus,
  His love for the dip,
  caused him to flip,
 Now we see what you missed,

A programmer called Thomas R,
Really loved a good chocolate bar,
His skills were so great,
He even coded when he ate,
Called his variables 'foo' and 'bar'.
