There once was a coder called Femi,
Whose feet really were rather smelly,
  His ace coding skills,
  Caused a life full of thrils,
He found it hard not to go spend a penny.

Another programmer called Imran,
Was the always a big fan,
  Of coding for good,
  Which he new he should,
And so now he helped another man.

There was a third programmer called thomas,
who ate a lot of humus,
  His love for the dip,
  caused him to flip,
 Now we see what you missed,

There once was another coder called Thomas,
He would always promise,
To comment his code,
so that it flowed,
before he left for carrots and houmous.
