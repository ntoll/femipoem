There once was a coder called Femi,
Whose feet really were rather smelly,
  His ace coding skills,
  Caused a life full of thrils,
He found it hard not to go spend a penny.

Another programmer called Imran,
Like driving around in a big van,
  It was decked out with kit,
  That caused folks to have fits,
So the Police enforced a driving ban.
